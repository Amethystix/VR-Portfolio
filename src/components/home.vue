        This website is where I'll be storing all of
        the content over the course of my independent study
        during my senior spring at NYU.

        I plan on working on projects in Virtual Reality,
        beginning with Web VR and seeing where things go from there.
        Over the course of the semester, I hope to accomplish several goals of mine:
        <ul>
          <li>To learn to program for virtual reality devices</li>
          <li>To work with 3D modeling software in order to create my own assets</li>
          <li>To utilize popular VR libraries in order to create social apps</li>
          <li>To demystify the process of programming in VR to other students by writing clean and well documented code</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the links to my VR works will be under the projects
        page.  Feel free to take a look at what I'm up to!  I'll be putting
        everything on my <a href="https://www.github.com/lad475">GitHub</a>.
